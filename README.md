# Chemicals-Segregation-using-sklearn-based-classifier

There two chemical flasks labelled '1' and '0' which contains two different chemicals. extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them.


Train: consists of two csv files LogisticXtrain and LogisticYtrain. Xtrain consists of the features whereas Ytrain consists of the labels associated with the features.

Test: consists of one file LogisticXtest consisting of the features of test data which we have to classify.

# Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours, and it also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy .

# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).
